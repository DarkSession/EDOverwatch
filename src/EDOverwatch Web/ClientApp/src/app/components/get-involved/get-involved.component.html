            <div>
                The Post Disaster Evacuation Service is a squadron dedicated to rescues from burning stations whenever
                there are some.
                Rescues provide a non combative way of helping to defeat Thargoid attacks for those who don't wish to
                fight the aliens,
                or to provide a mixture of activities for everyone else. Supplies and support are just as important as
                soldiers in a war.
