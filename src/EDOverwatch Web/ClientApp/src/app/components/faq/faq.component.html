                Why does the number of systems not match the number in-game?
            </div>
            <div>
                After the weekly tick on Thursday 7am UTC it usually takes a few hours until Overwatch received and
                processed all
                data about new alerts and invasions.<br>
                However, after that the difference is likely systems under invisible Thargoid control.
