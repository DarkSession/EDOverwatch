                All eight Titans have been defeated and there are currently no systems which are affected by any of the
                Thargoid war states.
                <br>
                <br>
                With the war coming to an end, DCoH Overwatch has served its purpose and is now read-only.

                    What happens to Overwatch?
                </div>
                Many would agree that we probably have not seen the last of the Thargoids. However, we do not know if
                the Thargoid war states as we have seen them the last 2 years will remain in-game.<br>
                For now, Overwatch has been set to read-only but can be reactivated at any time should we see Titans and
                Thargoid war states again.<br>
                If the game is going to phase out the Thargoid war states, we will keep Overwatch as read-only and
                eventually shut it down within a 24 - 48 months timeframe.<br>
                The API will remain available in the read-only phase.

                <div class="subtitle">
                    What happens with all the Thargoid war information stored in Overwatch?
                </div>
                All war related information will be exported and made available on <a
                   href="https://github.com/DarkSession/EDOverwatch.Archive"
                   class="link"
                   target="_blank"
                   rel="noreferrer">Github</a>.<br>
                This will likely take another 1-2 weeks from the time you
                are seeing this notice.
